# smokers-health-data-analysis
This project is my workshop and playground in data analysis field. 

I wanted to train basic visualization and data processing, but my main goal was to start thinking as data scientist
and I think that I have achieved this goal.

In this project I answered some questions about dataset. Questions are simple but I think they are relevant to the ones which people think of after looking at the dataset about smokers.

Analysing dataset I have focused on these issues:

1) Percentage of smokers and non smokers in the dataset

2) Percentage of male and females in the smoke group

3) Percentage of male smokers and female smokers in the dataset

4) Number of smokers and non smokers at given age

5) Answer to question does smoking affect people heart rate

6) Answer to question does smoking affect people cholesterol
